### Insights

* Over the last 3 years, homeownership rates have fallen from around 68% of the US to about 66%, with the starkest drop at the beginning of the COVID pandemic.
* Listed homes fluctuate on a yearly basis, and are continuing to rise after a steep drop throughout 2020.
* Housing affordability is increasing, though further variables are needed to support the hypothesis that homes are becoming more affordable.
* Mortgage interest rates are the highest they have been in 3 years, exceeding an astonishing 300% increase since 2020. This is likely due to the economic recovery attempts and may have a strong effect on homeownership rates and affordability.
